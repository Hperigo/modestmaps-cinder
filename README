Quick port of Modest Maps (modestmaps.com) to Cinder Framework (libcinder.org)

It's pretty stable at this point on the github Cinder master (as of 2010-08-31) 
with Boost 1.44. 

Progress and early bugs discussed here: 
http://forum.libcinder.org/#topic/23286000000108063

Now supports multitouch and rotations... ipad port next!

Next task: implement destructors for classes that need them and clarify the use 
of 'new' for providers and projections - perhaps std::auto_ptr is the 
clarification needed?

See also http://github.com/randometc/modestmaps-of for OpenFrameworks for a 
comparison. It's slightly less complete than this version, however.
