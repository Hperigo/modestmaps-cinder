Quick port of Modest Maps (modestmaps.com) to the Cinder Framework (libcinder.org)

Working on it: http://forum.libcinder.org/#topic/23286000000108063

Seeing occasional hard crashes so please be careful. Also seeing Cocoa errors when loading on a thread.

See also http://github.com/randometc/modestmaps-of for OpenFrameworks for a comparison.
