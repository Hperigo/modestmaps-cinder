Quick port of Modest Maps (modestmaps.com) to Cinder Framework (libcinder.org)

It's pretty stable at this point on the github Cinder master (as of 2010-08-31) 
with Boost 1.44. 

Should work as a Cinder Block, you just need to set the CINDER_PATH in xcode.
(Not yet tested in Visual Studio)

Progress and early bugs discussed here: 
http://forum.libcinder.org/#topic/23286000000108063

Now supports multitouch, rotations and works on ipad (not battle tested yet).

Next task: clarify the use of 'new' for providers and projections - perhaps 
std::auto_ptr is the clarification needed?

See also http://github.com/randometc/modestmaps-of for OpenFrameworks for a 
comparison. It's quite a bit less complete than this version, however.
