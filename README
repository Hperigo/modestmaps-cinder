Quick port of Modest Maps (modestmaps.com) to the Cinder Framework (libcinder.org)

Progress and early bugs discussed here: http://forum.libcinder.org/#topic/23286000000108063

Now supports multitouch and rotations... ipad port next.

It's pretty stable at this point on the github Cinder master (as of 2010-08-31) with Boost 1.44. Still seeing some Cocoa warnings when loading on a thread.

See also http://github.com/randometc/modestmaps-of for OpenFrameworks for a comparison.
